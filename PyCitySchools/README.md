**All About Pandas -- PyCitySchools**

As the Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district, my task is to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. I used an open source data analysis and manipulation tool, Pandas, and a next-generation web-based user interface, Jupyter Lab, to analyze district-wide raw data. 

My first task was to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I used this raw data to generate a table called District Summary, which represents a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics:

This overarching District Summary shows us the data that I will further analyzing: 15 schools with a budget of over $24 million dollars.

Next, I create an overview table that summarized the key metrics about each school.

**Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)** & **Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)**

Next, I created two tables highligting the top 5 performing schoolst and 5 worst-performing schools based on % Overall Passing.
